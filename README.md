## Implementating Mediapipe and LSTM architecture to detect Indonesian Sign Language

### Background
Communication is one of the ways every living being uses to facilitate conveying what they feel; communication itself 
has many forms, including verbal and nonverbal communication. In the results of a study, it was stated that 
75% of human time is used for communication. Whether it is communicating with others, communicating with oneself, or 
self-talk. Other research states that humans, especially women, produce 20,000 words daily to communicate or
express their opinions, thoughts, or problems they are contemplating.
