### Background
Communication is one of the ways every living being uses to facilitate conveying what they feel; communication itself 
has many forms, including verbal and nonverbal communication. In the results of a study, it was stated that 
75% of human time is used for communication. Whether it is communicating with others, communicating with oneself, or 
self-talk. Other research states that humans, especially women, produce 20,000 words daily to communicate or
express their opinions, thoughts, or problems they are contemplating.

However, verbal communication often becomes a significant challenge for deaf people. Deaf individuals have 
hearing that does not function, thus requiring special aids during interactions.
Communication that can be used with deaf people to facilitate the delivery and reception of messages is through 
non-verbal communication or sign language. Sign language becomes one means to make it easier for them to convey what 
they want to express. Sign language also serves as an important alternative to bridge the communication gap. Sign 
language has even become the primary means of communication for people who are deaf or hard of hearing worldwide.

In this rapidly evolving digital era, information accessibility for individuals with disabilities, 
particularly the hearing impaired, is of paramount importance. This research aims to develop a sign 
language recognition system based on Mediapipe and the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) method. 
The system is designed to recognize hand movements that represent various BISINDO, 
facilitating more effective communication.
